I'm Ignacio Brasca, a developer from Argentina currently living abroad (Italy>Sweden>Spain>Italy), with experience in web development, security, system design, scalability, finance, and game development.

Currently, I mainly focus on developing high-performance code for financial applications. However, most of the work I've done and am currently doing cannot be published due to [NDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement) restrictions. I previously worked for [PwC](https://www.pwc.com) at AI Labs. Before that, I helped build [Datia](https://datia.app) with an amazing team from scratch.

### Random
- In 2019, I met Mark Zuckerberg while reaching the finals with [OpenCurriculum](https://github.com/wattba/) at the F8 Global Hackathon in Facebook California.

- As a kid, I had access to my country's customs database. I was really interested in breaking things but kept my cool and reported the problem (nobody replied).

- As a kid, I developed and **"published"** independently two games: [The Recovery](https://juegosargentinos.org/therecovery) and [Caminante](https://juegosargentinos.org/caminante).

- I participated in the writing of two books about Cinema and Finance within [Estacion Cine](https://www.cgeditorial.com.ar/colecciones/estacion-cine/).

### Things I Like to Do Outside Professional Software
- Learning about almost everything (applied math, physics, biology, philosophy).

- Competitive Programming (Participation in Facebook F8 California and Facebook Hackathon Argentina).

- Compiler Design.

- Writing (refer to my [blog](https://blog.ignaciobrasca.com)).
  
- Making music as [Too Nano](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ByFHF2ZCZIeHg1O86JpiM) and [TXXNANO](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3wHoyAGjMlR9C8zoahstuF).
  
- I like to publish my work (if any) on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ignacio_Brasca).
