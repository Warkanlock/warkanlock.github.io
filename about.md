I'm Ignacio Brasca, a developer from Argentina living abroad (prev. Italy and Sweden, now Spain), with experience in web development, security, system design, scalability, finance and game development.

Now, I mainly focus on developing high-performance code for financial applications but most of the work I did and I'm doing cannot be published due to [NDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement).

I used to work for [PwC](https://www.pwc.com) at AI Labs.

Currently, I'm building [Datia](https://datia.app) with an amazing team.

### Random Facts
- In 2019, I met Mark Zuckerberg while getting into the finals with [OpenCurriculum](https://github.com/wattba/) on the F8 Global Hackathon in Facebook California.

- As a kid, I had access to my country's customs database. I was really interested in breaking things but I kept my cool and reported the problem (nobody replied).

- As a kid I developed and **"published"** independently two games ([The Recovery](https://juegosargentinos.org/therecovery) and [Caminante](https://juegosargentinos.org/caminante)).

- I participated in the writting of two books about Cinema and Finance within [Estacion Cine](https://www.cgeditorial.com.ar/colecciones/estacion-cine/).

### Things I like to do outside software
- Read about finance and business in general.
 
- Learning psychiatry

- Competitive Programming (Participation in Facebook F8 California and Facebook Hackathon Argentina)
  
- Make music as [Too Nano](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ByFHF2ZCZIeHg1O86JpiM) and [TXXNANO](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3wHoyAGjMlR9C8zoahstuF).
  
- I like to publish my work (If any) on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ignacio_Brasca).
