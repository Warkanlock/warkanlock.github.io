I'm Ignacio Brasca, a developer from Argentina with experience in web, [security](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ignacio_Brasca), system design and game development. 

I focus on developing performant code (and)keeping the architecture always in mind.

Currently, I'm working on Labs AI for PwC. 

In 2019, I got into the finals with [OpenCurriculum](https://github.com/wattba/) on the F8 Global Hackathon in Facebook California.
