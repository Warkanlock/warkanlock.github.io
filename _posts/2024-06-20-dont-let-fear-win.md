I think the whole culture is shifting towards a sense of panic towards work and thinking in general that generates a lot of anxiety in a lot of people out there; *to minimize anxiety you need to learn and have knowledge* to battle things are going on and to *understand* that things does not exists on the ether.

Everything has an explanation and almost everyone can do everything. Issue with this is gatekeepers.

Don't talk with gatekeeprs, don't play their game, don't.

Never let anyone tell you that you will be replaced as a thinker, dictatorships do that, and even if the political party does not exist and is inside a machine, you are much better than a multiplication matrix, and there are many things to build and create, do not be afraid.

Know more and open the doors of your own perception, but don't let them fool you with smoke and mirrors.

Use this new generation of tools as a stepping stone to the new age, don't get attached to what you were before, but be careful when you walk on this window floor: the cracks may not be visible if you live with the lack of knowledge but you will fill the gaps with magic and magic is always a bad thing if not entertainment, a tool someone uses to treat you like a fool.

Always focus on what you believe, not what other people(*corporations*) want you to believe.
