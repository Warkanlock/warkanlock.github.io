Yesterday [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) was released.

I can safely say (despite having been able to verify it with my own hands), that reality is coming to an end. Reading and seeing memes out there with a video and a prompt made me realize that we won't know anything in a few years. We won't be able to detect whether a video has been generated or not and even be able to describe or remember where the piece of footage came from. (E.g: [twitter post](https://twitter.com/billpeeb/status/1758650919430848991))

Any video that resembles but doesn’t mimic reality will be a possible candidate for AI.

Movies were always part of this “reality,” but with a consensus that to see fake reality, you will pay a ticket, rent a movie, or whatever.

Now, you won’t be able to accept terms and conditions.

Reality (despite being bombarded before) has ended as we know it.

A new set of technologies will be needed to check and verify reality as we know it; otherwise, nothing and everything will be possible. 

There’s no point in fighting back, and this won’t harm the common people (potentially, in the beginning). However, public figures, politicians, etc, will be in danger, and if I stretch this a bit more, a new [Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels) is being raised with these new tools and technologies.

These AI generative tools are [Bernays's wet dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays).

I guess it is just a matter for us to wait and see and wait for the best.

In the meantime, it is reasonable, safe, and sound to build verification, certification, and validation tools to avoid scapegoat reality. 

But being fair, I’m on the e/acc side, [effective accelerationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism), so I don’t have fear; I kinda like where things are going because I will end up being part of a new humanity, a new society with new problems, and a new set of challenges. 

There's quite a nostalgic aspect [to seeing old Londoners walking around the city in 1920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kubz9fYTTc). In my opinion, there is a break in time from there to now, and people in the future will see this invention as part of the same nostalgic look: a break that we needed to jump into the new century. 

We have just started a new revolution, not industrial or even material, but mental.

However, what does it matter by now?
