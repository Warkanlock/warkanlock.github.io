In 1993 an essay about burnout came out: [A further examination of managerial burnout](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/job.4030140103). In this paper, their authors described how burnout worked and why it is essential to have a financial commitment, satisfaction, and long-term vision in the problem we are working on.

> "Job and life satisfaction and time spent with clients and subordinates were also related to exhaustion. In turn, exhaustion was related to depersonalization, professional commitment, and turnover intentions."

A ton of investigation is made about the topic, although we still see burnout as a potential issue (and it is!) under bad conditions.

The issue is not burnout in the first place, in my opinion; it's part of an organization that makes you feel useless, empty, and replaceable. 

Every day it's exactly the same, and you are OK with it. You deserve to be treated better. If your decisions are not being listened to or if you feel your words are not being heard, just do it. Places need more people that speak with ideas and not with fear. Just quit if none in your organization is asking you to do anything, trust me, it's a silent doom. 

You will wake up one day, in a car you didn't want to buy in the first place, listening to music you liked but not anymore, reading news about things you don't care that much but just to feel a rush, an spike of adrenaline, something; 

In any opportunity, you have to learn, go ahead and learn. It's a gift to have time to understand things. Do not wait for the knowledge to come by itself. Good knowledge is what we do with time when we are not doing anything else.  

If you need to get things done, you must do it [fast](https://patrickcollison.com/fast) and better than everyone. [Paypal didn't win it's play with Ebay playing easy ](https://www.amazon.com/PayPal-Wars-Battles-Media-Planet/dp/1936488590). Neither [Carmack agreed on everything Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom) said. All of those discussions made our world a better place. It's always an idea being discussed and someone blocking it from happening. You won't agree too much with everyone you work with (and if you do, revisit it!); you will stress yourself daily if you think you can live without disagreements or discussions.

Hard work is about disagreements. 
Hard work is about consistently solving issues you didn't know existed before.

Burnout is about sacrifices; being part of an organization that makes you work from 8/5 has benefits and that's OK as well. Although, aside from exceptional cases, feeling important in a thousand-plus organization it's an illusion. You are not that good nor that important.

Sometimes it's just understanding that your contributions have to be good enough for you and only to make you feel happy with your work. 

Compliments are a terrible way of putting incentives on people and making you feel part of the organization you are in; People need to understand their place and don't ask for permission. You are great and that's why you are there. That's how [Sonny Vaccaro got Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Vaccaro).

Perhaps it's just you, not an organization, and you are against the world as an entrepreneur. Either way, you need to keep your time for yourself and grind all the way through it.

Work will never get done, there's always more work to do;

![high output management quote](https://blog.ignaciobrasca.com/img/posts/random/pic-7.jpeg)

Generally speaking, great things don't take much to get done (astronomical terms); decisions are the things that take a while to grasp. There's where burnout comes in: decisions without ideas to back up the plan to build. Structures without soul. Building without blueprints.

> Christopher Alexander

Don't let your own nature prevent things from happening,
Once the decision to make it real has been made,
Go ahead and build it.
