Last night, I was writing an [abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) ([a DAG, precisely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)) that I learned about back in college. 

I've been writing code for years, but it's rare to encounter daily situations where abstract code like this is applicable (other than live-code sessions on interviews).

Nevertheless, I decided to dive into the implementation from a theorical point of view, just to implement the algo later, just a fun experiment, only to realize I had almost forgotten how to do it.

I felt like I knew how to proceed after reading the theory, so I went back to my editor.  After a few minutes of typing and building the necessary scaffolding, I embarked on the task...

I needed two things: a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) that supports a structure without cycles and a few intrinsic characteristics for the nodes that are work-domain related and I cannot disclose.

Just for fun and the joy of recreational programming (inspired by [tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding)), I decided to run:

```
:Copilot disable
```

Oh boy, what a mental ride after that...

I've been riding the AI wave for quite some time, but I was concerned about switching to code-enhancing tools. Don't ask me why, but I hesitated to use them.

So, when I started using [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) after a while they released it, I immediately felt the speed. At first, I didn't know how to `drive` the tool, but after a few weeks, I got the hang of it: 1) write a signature, 2) explain in comments what you want, and 3) wait and modify the result to match your expectations.

And so I did.

> Note: I've been coding since I was 9 years old, so I knew how to code. Additionally, Copilot felt right at first because it removed the bloated unnecessary stuff that I didn't want to write in the first place.

Going back to the DAG, I was stuck, blank. I threw down a few lines, wrote some logic test cases, and still, nothing. The urge to activate Copilot was huge, especially since I had two meetings on the horizon and needed to complete the task quickly.

After a few minutes of whiteboarding, I got it.

I returned to the code, wrote it, and spent the rest of the day feeling good because I `could` still program. However, a sense of bitterness lingered. Are we getting rusty in programming? Is Copilot good or bad for our industry? How can I know?

I just wanted to have fun, but here I am, sacrificing all I learned for speed. I believe I'll end up deactivating it for a while, as it makes our brains completely dependent and erases the muscle memory of coding after a few months of not using it for actual programming.

I realized that coding isn't just writing; it's the act of thinking. With the speed of `Copilot`, you can't even think of the solution before the output is there, ready for you to press `return` and move on.

Go ahead.

Try it out for yourself.

```
:Copilot disable
