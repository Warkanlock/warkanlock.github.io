When I was a kid, I was terrified of exposing ideas in public. Speaking out loud, asking for someone’s attention, trying to convince others of what I was saying.

That fear shaped me. It built a mental model so toxic that it made me want to stay silent, to avoid expressing what I wanted or believed.

At the beggining of this year, I was dianosed with autism spectrum disorder (yeah, I know a lot of people auto-diagnose themselves, but this was a professional evaluation). The diagnosis explained a lot of things about how I perceive the world and interact with it.

That’s why I’ve started to change recently.

Acceptance is understanding your limits, recognizing where you feel comfortable and where you simply don’t. I used to think that expressing ideas—moving them from your mind into the physical world—was something everyone could do easily. But after spending time digging into myself, my psyche, and working with my therapist, I realized something else entirely.

Each instinct, each behavioral tendency, gives you an advantage in one area and a disadvantage in another. Trying to force yourself into situations that don’t match how your mind works—competition, physical intensity, high-exposure environments—can feel like frustraiting, like pushing against a wall every time but you are simply a blow of air.

Nowadays, instead of trying to fit myself into spaces that simply feel wrong, I ask a simple question: should I expose myself here? Is there real benefit in doing it, or is the cost too high?

If the answer is yes, if I sense harm or friction, I step back.

I now choose calm over chaos.

Now I know what I'm valuable for and for what not.

And that’s fine.

Everyone has limits.

What matters is understanding yours well enough to see your real potential and not waste yourself fighting battles that don’t belong to you.
