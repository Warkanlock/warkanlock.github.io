I've been using chatGPT to improve things I've been doing as a hobby, like compilers research, low-level emulators, or language design (fields where I don't have any professional experience), and my phase of learning has increased a ton since then

I could see how this will help us as a society, but it depends strictly on the human input using this tool. You need to know X to at least start learning about it. The existence and depth of potential good topics provided by a model like GPT depends rigorously on the inputs provided 
So far, chatGPT cannot replace a book (lol), but it can help us to practice and to change the dynamics of the learning process

In the past, at least for me, this process has been: 

```reading -> practice -> blocker -> [discussion + research](X hours taken) -> repeat ```


Now, learning changed. No task is daunting right now, not even building a compiler from scratch

Since GPT, this process has been:

```discovery -> introduction -> [interactive practice + reading] -> blocker -> [interactive resolution + reading] -> repeat```

The hard part, so far, has been the inputs I provide to the model. 

I have to decide what is the kick start to the learning process of making a compiler. But again, that's my fault for not knowing the curriculum, and maybe the books will do this part of the work in the future.

This can be quickly reacted with: **"but the information is already there; you can search on the internet,"** and that's wrong. Whoever claims it does not understand how the Internet works starting from 2001 and the rise of the corpos ([*Adam Curtis, E6, Can't get you out of my head*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14036864/)) 

So far, these are the domains I'm improving using this new technology:

- A teacher for my Italian skills
- A compiler expert that gives me learning topics and summaries from books in the field (like the Dragon Book)
- A manager for an emulator project I've been building
