I have not posted any articles or ideas on this site for a few months now. The reason is still fuzzy, but since I changed jobs my life has undergone a surge of dopamine and a sense of fulfillment. The worst part of a job you don't like is working somewhere (or with someone) you can't stand. You start to become negative because you can't understand why everyone around you doesn't see what you see. Now, moving back to the present, I feel comfortable in an environment that makes me feel significant through solving complex problems, which is paradoxically: **uncomfortable**.

It must be wrong. Right?

Now, every time I wake up I think about all those people who happened to be in meetings, chats, calls, or offices who are now solely dust in my memory. Literally, they don't even have shape in my memories and I can't remember their faces, but somehow, at a point in time, they were my entire world.

Life must be something more than just *work*.

[But in a way, dignifies us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity_of_labour), gives us an automatic meaning, a classification that we can attach to ourselves without too much thinking. There are a few articles about people discussing how Google's prestige might be gone now, but is your prestige merely the prestige of the firm you are working with?

Are your friends just a set of goals for the sake of utilitarianism?

I've been at peace because I know life for me now is a bit more than working and reading.

Nowadays our field and industry is becoming broader and broader with less meaningful work to do.

There's [an article from The New York Times](https://archive.ph/HVZRL), saying that at Amazon workers feel more and more as warehouse workers, which my first thought is: **of course**.

People like the [Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski) exists just as an icon of this era, modern times of people that works just to be part of a cult. Yes, Ted **did work**.

So going back to now, we are in a similar transition: we are working to live in a life we don't own anymore. Our meaning it's tight to things we don't even care anymore but it's OK, where we are going we won't need things.

AI, Artificial Inteligence, Linear Algebra, whatever name you want to put on it, it's just the forecast of an era that no longer accept a **No** for an answer.

You and me and everyone else will be able to just cope or perish. But it's fine. The pressure of choose bring us here, so I guess it's part of the information optimization theory.

Before it was money, now it's not even that.

[Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) as a way of live.

In our days, system cards, programming jargon, tales about success, expensive cars and expensive watchs, everyone wants to live a life no longer exists with people no longer live.

Meaning it's a powerful tool, and it might be the unique one to survive on what's coming.
