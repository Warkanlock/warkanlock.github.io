Today I generated myself,

I don't listen to the same artist anymore, now I just listen to noise that sounds like music,

I see pictures on the internet showing what I think is a dog, but a dog will be something else,

The human species entered a dark alley of false promises and almost true data. A world in which everyone and everything is almost but not completely true,

I don't panic, I enjoy humans transmuting into a new species,

I went to Spotify to listen again to Alan's Parson project, the lyrics are always the same, monotony in the future will cost. Generating music will be easy, cheaper and better than buying records,

I see a world in which everyone will try to be their own model,
I see a world in which everyone will cease to be,
I see a world,

A maybe good and brave new world.
