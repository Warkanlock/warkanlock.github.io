Usually, through the history of humankind, there has been different kind of technological revolutions that completely vanished the sole existence of productivity we knew back in that time (e.g: the printing press, the agrarian revolution, the weapon industry, etc)

Now, while watching [All the President’s Man](https://letterboxd.com/film/all-the-presidents-men/) I realized of something I notice from movies of the 70’s: people were there getting shit done and while they were doing this, the “system” worked. For bad and for good, of course… [Inequality wasn’t that bad either way](https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/) and it was possible to do your way through life.

Every seems to have “their eyes in the game” trying to achieve fame, glory, a carear, and the trust of public institutions was good enough to convey with a life of productivity, prosperity, industrial corridors and infrastructure, just before all went hell with Watergate, [MK Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra), [Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor), etc.

According to the [World bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/governance/trust-public-institutions) having a high confidence score with an institution will mean not only that the institution will do it’s job better, but more effective: spending less and doing more, in sense.

Now, let’s do a game: imagine you are a person in their forties reading the newspaper and you find now Watergate, you read the scandal…

**What would you do?**

Or let's even put this way:

You pay taxes, you do your job, you go to work, yo go back, and you expect money to be there when you need it, or even better you expect the government to take care of you.  While the system works, you expect the government to take care of you. But what if the system doesn't work?

To who you complain? 

Justice?

So, what we should do when [facebook leak exposes users' private data to hackers](https://cybernews.com/security/facebook-leak-exposes-users-hackers-claim/)?

Or a company we know, such as Ikea removing thousands of [acres of forest in Brazil](https://disclose.ngo/en/article/ikeas-main-supplier-in-brazil-accused-of-environmental-damage)?

Or what happened with VW with [Dieselgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselgate)?

And let's not say "hey, but they pay the fines!!!"...that's what justice is about.

Let’s see other examples, for example on countries

Nepal, which by the way, there’s a terrific blog post of a friend about this scandal while he was there (https://schmud.de/posts/2025-09-18-signs-in-the-fire-kathmandu.html). Of course people took the streets and claim the power back because of corruption. But, now what? Their politicians flew with the money back to Dubai and they are probably laughing about this with other billionaires.

Serbia’s student were on the streets, clashes, fires, destroyed houses, impossible transportation, while…**politicians do what?**

France is in the edge of collapse, so what?

Israel and Palestina conflict it’s simply hilarious to even think about and the mental gymnastic some people has to do to justify it it’s simply out of this world

You see the pattern here? 

Anywhere you go with it: it’s chaos, it’s collapse, and the most important emotion: anger and despair.

It’s what feeds the moguls: the war.

But, hey, this is the world we live ***in right now***, right?

There are wars everywhere, proxy wars, real wars, decoy wars, etc…

But hey, don’t eat the hand that feeds. 

Don’t critize. 

Everyone else is doing a performance act, a “dance” while going to work for Monsanto...

But let’s not blame the people as [in the quiz show scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_quiz_show_scandals), we just need to obey and satisfy otherwise we will perish; who will feed us?

You just keep with your day and try to be as productive as possible while you align yourself with what you read the most while you are the toilet…

The industrial complex it’s in decay but now China, who a few years back followed the tracks of human degrade with things as [Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_power_grows_out_of_the_barrel_of_a_gun) it’s taking control of everything.

While politicians in America kill each other and it seems McCarthyism is back again in the streets.

I can ever see [Trumbo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Trumbo) in cinemas in 2030

What’s now on us, to build something, that has meaning? 

What’s on us to understand that we are special?

Maybe a few years back we thought governments will carry over but even now European union it’s still fighting with 20-years problem while politicians decide which kind of plastic we should not use on plastic bottles, because hey! that’s even more important than China bombarding your market with cheaper and more harmful products 

[Wellfare is simply not enough neither sustainable](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/12/in-germany-social-welfare-is-no-longer-sustainable_6745324_19.html)

Reading through [breakneck](https://danwang.co/breakneck/) which by the way is an excellent introduction to why China is breaking everyones assess in the world (a bit kind of propaganda since it does not mention slavery as “slavery”) I realized that what divide us know it’s simply to not have a meaning at all…China has it, despite all the moral issues it could cause on the west.

We are not slaves, it’s not about that, it’s that the institutions that should protect us are protecting them, the game it’s rigged

[Institutions have failed us and it’s clear to the world now](https://www.aamchealthjustice.org/news/polling/trust-trends) that this is simply not admissible. 

From where I from, all institutions are dead anyways, nobody trust the public anymore, even if it’s from the government, which is common, but I believe this virus is now spread in the world. 

Maybe on purpose.

If institutions won’t be there to save us, corporations will, and don’t let me use an Aline reference here, but boy oh boy, don’t you ever trust in a monkey with billons.
